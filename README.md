## Smart contract languages

Name ⇩            | Description
------------------|-------------------------------
[DAML][100]       | An open-source smart contract language for building future-proof distributed applications on a safe, privacy-aware runtime. DAML is based on Haskell; it is a functional programming language that draws on many Haskell characteristics, such as strong typing, and utilizes the GHC compiler. 
[Liquidity][101]  | A high-level language to program Smart Contracts for [Tezos](https://www.tezos.com). It is a fully typed functional language, it uses the syntax of OCaml, and strictly complies with Michelson security restrictions.
[NEO Smart Contract][102] | The NEO smart contract can be used directly by almost any high-level programming language. Among the first supported languages is F#.
[Pact][103]       | Pact is immutable, deterministic, and Turing-incomplete. Based on LISP, Pact strikes a balance between low-level directly executable expressions and high-level declarative code.
[Plutus][104]     | A strictly typed pure functional programming language used for defining smart contracts in [Cardano](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/home). The syntax is fairly Haskell-like, but unlike Haskell, the language is eagerly evaluated.
[Simplicity][105] | A typed, combinator-based, functional language without loops and recursion, designed to be used for crypto-currencies and blockchain applications.
