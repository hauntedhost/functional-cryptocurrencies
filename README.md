## Cryptocurrencies

Name | Programming Language
----|--------------------

Status (SNT) | Clojure/Script
Aeternity (AE) | Erlang, Elixir
Tezos (XTZ) | OCaml, Coq

## Smart contract languages

- [Plutus](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/plutus/introduction): A strictly typed pure functional programming language used for defining smart contracts in [Cardano](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/home). The syntax is fairly Haskell-like, but unlike Haskell, the language is eagerly evaluated.
- [Liquidity](http://www.liquidity-lang.org): A high-level language to program Smart Contracts for [Tezos](https://www.tezos.com). It is a fully typed functional language, it uses the syntax of OCaml, and strictly complies with Michelson security restrictions.
- [Simplicity](https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf): A typed, combinator-based, functional language without loops and recursion, designed to be used for crypto-currencies and blockchain applications.
